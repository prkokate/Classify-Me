Problem Statement: Sentiment Analysis for Customer Feedback

Background

A large e-commerce company receives thousands of customer feedback messages daily. 
These messages provide valuable insights into customer satisfaction and areas needing improvement.
However, manually analyzing such a large volume of feedback is impractical. To address this, the company aims 
to develop a machine learning model that can automatically classify customer feedback into sentiment categories.


Objective

Develop a sentiment analysis model to classify customer feedback into three categories: Positive, Negative, and Neutral. 
Use NLP embeddings to represent the feedback messages numerically and build a classification model to accurately predict the sentiment of each message.


Data Description
The dataset consists of two main components:

Embeddings: Each feedback message is converted into a numerical vector using pre-trained NLP models like BERT, Word2Vec, or GloVe. 
These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.

Example: [0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ..., -0.321]

Labels: Each feedback message is annotated with a sentiment label indicating the sentiment expressed.

Example: Positive (1), Negative (-1), and Neutral (0)
