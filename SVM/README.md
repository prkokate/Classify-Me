Used SVM because it is a powerful classifier, especially for binary classification tasks, and is known for its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces. 
SVM aims to find the hyperplane that best separates the classes by maximizing the margin between them.

Advantages

•	SVMs are less prone to overfitting, especially with high-dimensional data.

•	SVMs can be very effective when the number of dimensions exceeds the number of samples.

•	SVMs can efficiently perform non-linear classification using kernel functions, allowing them to handle complex relationships in the data.


Accuracy Achieved

The SVM achieved the following accuracy:

•	Training Accuracy: 92.49%

•	Validation Accuracy: 61.73%



Improvements

•	Adjusting the regularization parameter C to control the trade-off between achieving a low training error and a low testing error.
