Used a neural network (NN) due to its flexibility and power in handling high-dimensional data, such as the 768-dimensional features provided in this dataset.
Neural networks are particularly good at capturing complex, non-linear relationships between input features and output labels, which is essential for many classification tasks.

Advantages

•	Flexibility: Neural networks can model complex patterns and interactions within the data.
•	Feature Learning: The network can automatically learn useful features from the raw input data.
•	Non-linearity: Through activation functions, neural networks can capture non-linear relationships in the data.


Accuracy Achieved

The neural network achieved the following accuracy:

- Training Accuracy: Approximately 41%
- Validation Accuracy: Approximately 39%
  
The low accuracy of the neural network model can be attributed to several factors. Firstly, the input data might contain anomalies or noise that are not effectively handled, leading to poor learning outcomes.
Additionally, the neural network architecture might not be well-suited for the dataset, with potential overfitting due to a complex model or underfitting due to an overly simplistic one.
